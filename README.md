# credit-card-checker
A Codecademy Pro JavaScript project

This was a challenge set by Codecademy to test the user's Javascript knowledge obtained in the JavaScript: Arrays, Loops, and Object section.

The only code written by the CodeCademy team are the arrays declared at the top, everything else was written by myself.
